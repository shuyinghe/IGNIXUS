# A New Era of AI investment in Biopharma

While AI investment is prevalent across almost every sector, the biopharma industry exhibits a distinct trajectory of increasing strategic collaboration. A key difference between 2024 and 2025 is a clear shift from exploratory partnerships to more strategic, integrated, and well-funded collaborations. These newer deals are focused on specific, high-impact applications of AI.

## 2024: Foundational Partnerships and Exploratory Deals

In 2024, the biopharma AI deal landscape was still in a more nascent, exploratory phase. While there were significant deals, they were often aimed at establishing a foothold in the AI space and testing the technology's capabilities.

### High-Value Partnerships: Major deals in 2024 were characterized by large potential milestone payments, often exceeding $1 billion. Examples include Roche's partnership with Dyno Therapeutics for AAV gene therapy vectors and Recursion's acquisition of Exscientia, highlighting the industry's willingness to invest heavily in the promise of AI.

## 2025: Integration, Execution, and Consolidation

The dealmaking environment in 2025 is characterized by three key trends:

### Deep Integration and Platform Deals: Instead of one-off projects, major pharmaceutical companies are entering into deeper, platform-based collaborations with selected biotech partners like Circle Pharma and insitro. This signals a shift toward building a collaborative ecosystem where a single platform can power multiple discovery efforts.

### Focus on Specific Modalities: Deals are increasingly centered on using AI to solve complex, targeted problems, suchs as protein structure prediction, molecular glue discovery, and RNA-based therapeutics. This is evident in collaborations like Absci's partnership with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and TME Pharma's work with aimed analytics to develop AI-based cancer drugs.

### Significant Private Funding: There's been a trend of large, private funding rounds for AI-first biotechs. For instance, Isomorphic Labs (an Alphabet spin-out) secured a massive $600 million private round in Q1 2025, showing strong investor confidence in AI's potential to transform drug discovery.

### AI in Clinical Trials: The application of AI is expanding beyond the lab and into the clinic. Companies are using AI to streamline patient recruitment, optimize trial design, and analyze real-world data, all with the goal of shortening development timelines and increasing the success rate of clinical programs.

## Summary

In essence, 2024 was the year of building the foundation and making bold statements about AI's importance. 2025 represents the year of executing on that vision, with more refined, integrated, and application-specific deals that aim to translate the promise of AI into tangible progress in the drug development pipeline.
