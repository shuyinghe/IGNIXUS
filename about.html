        <li><strong>Pillar 2: Global External Innovation & Cross-Cultural Dealmaking</strong></li>
            <p>I pivoted to leading global external innovation, focusing on the evaluation and execution of high-stakes corporate partnerships:</p>
        <p><strong>Key Achievement:</strong> Led international dealmaking efforts and executed complex, billion-dollar worth partnerships, secured value-creating investments that significantly expanded global market presence.</p>
